# DigitalOcean Security Policy

We strive to create a safe, resilient environment where our customers and community can innovate with confidence. While we do a lot of things to make sure our environment is safe, we can make mistakes. When we do, we want you to let us know! 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT file a public issue to report a security vulnerability in one of our repositories. Instead, send your report privately to our [public vulnerability disclosure program](https://hackerone.com/digitalocean), run in partnership with HackerOne. This will allow any vulnerabilities that are found to be disclosed responsibly to any affected parties.

We will not take legal action against nor ask law enforcement to investigate researchers who reach out and work with us in good faith, including:
- Sharing the full details of the issue with us
- Making a good faith effort to avoid violating our customers' (or our) privacy, destroying data, and interrupting or degrading our services
